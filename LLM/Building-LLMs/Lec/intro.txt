ELIZA talking -- first of the chat bot 

close source model and open weight model 



large language model -- LLM
nerual networks designed to understand, generate and respond to human like text
core of llm is nn 


large in llm --> models have billon of paramters and growing day by day. 
what is token size ? 


if large model means that is only deals with language 
then how gpt is able to undersatnd image ? 

The shift from LLM (Large Language Model) to LMM (Large Multimodal Model) is a direct response to these models moving beyond text-only capabilities. 




why LLM is so better than NLP ? 
that is transformer architecture ?


LLM < Deep Learning < Machine Learning < AI
diff between deep learning and machine learning. 


bsically ai and ml have diff like if the ai is learning rule based then its not ml 
ai when have ability to learn from data then it is ml
am i right ?

and when machine learning model uses NN then it is deep learning ?
