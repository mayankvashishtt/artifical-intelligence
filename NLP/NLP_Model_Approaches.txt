To understand what complexity means, we need to understand - What does a Language consist of?

Language is a structured system of communication that involves complex combinations of its constituent components, such as characters, words, sentences, etc.
The systematic study of language is called Linguistics.

Heuristics-Based Approach (Rule-Based)
You manually write rules based on human logic and experience.
No learning. No data.
Just IF–ELSE rules.

Example (Spam detection)

Rules:
IF email contains “win money” → spam
IF email contains “free offer” → spam

Pros & Cons

✅ Easy to understand
✅ Works for small problems

❌ Breaks easily
❌ Cannot handle new patterns
❌ Huge number of rules needed

Where it was used

Early spell checkers
Simple chatbots
Early email filters

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine Learning Approach
Instead of writing rules, you give examples and let the computer learn the rules itself.

You provide:

Text
Correct labels
The model learns patterns.

Example (Spam detection)

Training data:
| Email           | Label    |
| --------------- | -------- |
| “Win money now” | Spam     |
| “Meeting at 5”  | Not Spam |

Model learns:
Which words indicate spam
How strongly they indicate spam
Then it computes:
P(Spam | email)

Pros & Cons

✅ Learns from data
✅ Adapts to new patterns
✅ Much more accurate

❌ Needs labeled data
❌ Feature engineering required

Algorithms used
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
SVM

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Learning Approach

The model learns everything automatically, including:
Features
Patterns
Context
Meaning

Inspired by the human brain (neural networks).

Example (Spam detection)
Deep model:
Understands context
Understands phrasing
Handles slang & variations

Example:
“Congratulations 🎉 you’ve been selected”
Even without “win money”, it detects spam.

Pros & Cons

✅ Best accuracy
✅ Understands context & meaning
✅ Handles huge data

❌ Needs lots of data
❌ Computationally expensive
❌ Harder to interpret

Models used
RNN / LSTM
Transformers (BERT, GPT)
