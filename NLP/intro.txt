Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NLP is a field of AI that helps computers understand, generate, and respond to human language (text or speech) in a useful way.


We talk to these assistants not in a programming language, but in our Natural Language — the language we all communicate in.

So, how do computers make sense of it?
Computers or these devices/machines can only process data in binary, i.e., 0s and 1s.
While we can represent language data in binary, how do we make machines understand the language?
This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes in.

An area of computer science that deals with methods to analyze, model, and understand human language. 
Every intelligent application involving human language has some NLP behind it.

Core application areas:

Email platforms --> Gmail, Outlook, etc.,
use NLP extensively to provide a range of product features, such as spam classification, priority inbox, calendar event extraction, auto-complete, etc.

Voice-based assistants, --> Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Amazon Alexa
rely on a range of NLP techniques to interact with the user, understand user commands, and respond accordingly.

Modern search engines --> Google and Bing
query understanding, query expansion, question answering, information retrieval, and ranking and grouping of the results, to name a few.

Machine translation services --> Google Translate, Bing Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate

Organizations across verticals analyze their social media feeds to build a better and deeper understanding of the voice of their customers.

E-commerce platforms like Amazon: are extracting relevant information from product descriptions to understanding user reviews.

NLP is used in a range of learning and assessment tools and technologies, such as automated scoring in exams like the
Graduate Record Examination (GRE),
plagiarism detection (e.g., Turnitin),
Intelligent tutoring systems, and
language learning apps like Duolingo.

Commonly Implemented Tasks in NLP:

Main NLP tasks that appear frequently across various NLP projects:

1.Language modeling: Choosing the most probable word sequence
This is the task of predicting what the next word in a sentence will be based on the history of previous words. 
The goal of this task is to learn the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a given language. Language modeling is useful for building solutions for a wide variety of problems, such as
spelling correction,
speech recognition,
optical character recognition,
handwriting recognition, and
machine translation.
Language modeling: learns how likely word sequences are, so machines can choose the most natural and correct sentence in any situation.

2.Text classification: This is the task of bucketing the text into a known set of categories based on its content. 
Text classification is by far the most popular task in NLP and is used in a variety of tools, from email spam identification to sentiment analysis.
Taking a piece of text and assigning it to one of the predefined categories (labels) based on its meaning.
Think of it like sorting messages into folders.
Example:
Text: “Congratulations! You won ₹10,000”
Category: Spam
“Bucketing into known categories” — what does that mean?
Known categories = labels are already decided
Model’s job = choose which label fits best
Example categories:
Spam / Not Spam
Positive / Negative / Neutral
So this is a supervised learning task (labels are known during training).

3.Information extraction: As the name indicates, this is the task of extracting relevant information from text, 
such as calendar events from emails or the names of people mentioned in a social media post.
Gmail extracts destination from tickets whenever we are traveling.
Email text:
“Your flight from Delhi to Bengaluru departs on 25 Dec at 6:30 AM.”
Information extracted:
From: Delhi
To: Bengaluru
Date: 25 Dec
Time: 6:30 AM
Type: Flight

4.Information retrieval: This is the task of finding documents relevant to a user query from a large collection. Applications like Google Search are well-known use cases of information retrieval.
Semantic seach engine

5.Conversational agent: This is the task of building dialogue systems that can converse in human languages. 
Alexa, Siri, etc., are some common applications of this task.

6.Text summarization: This task aims to create short summaries of longer documents while retaining the core content and preserving the overall meaning of the text.
Inshorts
Creating automated abstracts

7.Question answering: This is the task of building a system that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language.

8.Machine translation: This is the task of converting a piece of text from one language to another. Tools like Google Translate are common applications of this task.

9.Topic modeling: This is the task of uncovering the topical structure of a large collection of documents. 
Topic modeling is a common text-mining tool and is used in a wide range of domains, from literature to bioinformatics.
